The FED uses rate of GDP growth as an indicator towards monetary (expansionary or contractionary) policies. With approximately 2/3rd of GDP driven by consumer, the "Retail Trade Sales &amp; Food Services Sales" is a good proxy for consumer spending.  After performing the necessary transformations on the FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis RSAFS data for the period of January 1992 to March 2017, and differencing the data because of the presence of a Unit Root, the correlograms (ACF &amp; PACF) were plotted. Utilized Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) &amp; Seasonal-ARIMA modeling techniques to derive model for forecasting future value of RSAFS which is a major component of US GDP. Diagnostic testing was performed on the initial models guessed based on the correlograms, and the one with the least BIC was used to forecast the future.
